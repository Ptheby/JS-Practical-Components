# JS-Practical-Components
Task- Mastering Practical JS: From DOM Interactions to Building Components

//Calculator Project
We used html to create the form and inputs for the calculator. We used classes to target by name in the JS mainly. WOn the quantity we used a range to create the slider
In the JS we created price input, quantity input, and total variables using the document.querySelector and grabbed those using the names for the price and quantity and the class for total and then the quantity label. 
the primary function we created was to calculate the total cost by using the "inputs" for price and quantity from the html and mutiplying them together in the cost variable. We then user innerText to manipulate the total class from the html and input
the cost variable into it. The event listeners were placed on one priceInput and two on quantity one for the calculator itself and one for the quantity label for the slider. 

Challenges faced is mainly remembering how we can use all the different elements of HTML with bootstrap and how we can link those to JS along the way. I understand what he was doing watching and coding along but it would take me 10 times longer to do this on my own but it was really cool to see it all work and figure out what i had wrong along the way which when copying what he was doing was only typos. One example of dozens that throw me off is something like this form the price div:
  <div class="form-group">
            <label for="price">Price</label>
            <input type="text" class="form-control" name="price" 
            value="30"

            the input element has the class "form-control"   those kinds of thing i dont know what it means but can look up. 

///Button Playgournd Project
I'm getting more familiar with event listeners and how to apply them. Some of the main things that are a challenge are actually realizing that several things he's doing is built in or i believe are built in bootstrap things. I am still so new that I need to know if something is built in or just made up by him or anyone and the significance of most things or everything.  I also am getting more comfortable with querySelector.

///Coding Playground

Signed up at Codepen.io and put my code from the last project in there. Uploading GIF


///Stopwatch
The stop watch was more good pratice on everything. It does get somewhat confusing along the way and I could not get it to work correctly. After debugging everythong i could find ane eliminating all the errors on console i could not find anything else. Joe helped me walk through all the code also. FInally we caught two typos in Chat Gtp that solved all the issues and it works. My biggest challenges only have to do with understand everything he is doing and why.

//Accordion
My accordion is not working exactly as it should, it is bunching up and cannot figure out why. Need to call into code coach tomorrow because Chat Gtp is of no help on this one. I don't get a ton out of just following along with a guy flying through the steps when im not sure what he is doing or why he's doing things for a good oprtion of it. He knows infinitely more than I do and is just building this project while i copy him. Some of it is familiar but I did not take much from it personally. 


//Scrolling Progress
Similar to the accordion i just copied what he did. The biggest thing i am solifiying is possibly how to grab things in the doc and event listeners, the rest was cofusing because he knows so much more than i do and flies through the project
