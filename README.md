Task- Mastering Practical JS: From DOM Interactions to Building Components

//Calculator Project
We used html to create the form and inputs for the calculator. We used classes to target by name in the JS mainly. WOn the quantity we used a range to create the slider
In the JS we created price input, quantity input, and total variables using the document.querySelector and grabbed those using the names for the price and quantity and the class for total and then the quantity label. 
the primary function we created was to calculate the total cost by using the "inputs" for price and quantity from the html and mutiplying them together in the cost variable. We then user innerText to manipulate the total class from the html and input
the cost variable into it. The event listeners were placed on one priceInput and two on quantity one for the calculator itself and one for the quantity label for the slider.
